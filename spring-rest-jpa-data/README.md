## Possible Error Solution

* if mention about Java, check JAVA_HOME path, and version, java10 is not supported. [how to change java version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21964709/how-to-set-or-change-the-default-java-jdk-version-on-os-x)
* if mention about port being used, open process manager to kill java process and try again. 
* if everything fails, try mvn clean and build again.
